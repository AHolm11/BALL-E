ok heres my thoughts on the playing for the right team dilema. so if the sign of team is negative, then its on blue team. so if we
have the general direction of the orange goal hardcoded in to make the general direction the bot has to hit it in the generally correct 
direction, like if its on our half and far away from the target goal, its a very wide range the bot can hit it, probably 130?? degrees
half or something which would be the equivelant of just a big clear to the enemy corner, however as we get closer to the enemy goal we
narrow that range to get more accurate shots in. The advantage of the wide angle is that the bot will just hit the ball away instead
of trying to get the perfect angle and taking forever.
